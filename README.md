# Fermentation Data Analysis Coursework
## Data cleaning, Principal Component Analysis & Multiple Linear Regression model
This coursework will analyse the data from a mathematical simulation of a 100,000 litre penicillin fermentation system called [IndPenSim](http://www.industrialpenicillinsimulation.com/). The data set, generated by IndPenSim, involved 100 batches being run on the simulation. For each run, process and Raman spectroscopy data were collected and this data was downloadable from [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pdnjz7zz5x/2](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pdnjz7zz5x/2) (DOI:10.17632/pdnjz7zz5x.2).

I chose the IndPenSim dataset because it closely mirrors the type of process data I am generating during my industrial placement at UCB, where I am working in the early-stage upstream processing team as part of my MEng. My current project involves evaluating two cell line clones producing bispecific antibodies across the Ambr250 and 10L bioreactor scales. I aim to assess how process scale and various setpoints affect clone performance, titre, and product quality.

Although my experimental data is still being collected, this dataset allows me to build a reusable analysis pipeline. In this coursework, I aim to investigate how different process variables influence penicillin yield. By visualising the data, performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and applying a Multiple Linear Regression model, I will explore which variables most significantly affect yield. This approach will inform my strategy for analysing my own experimental data later on and help me identify key drivers of process performance.
